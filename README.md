# ConsoleApp1

Thought process:
1. Make a GET request 
2. Study the response - a list of races of 3 kinds
3. How to compare the races - Convert the response into a list of objects by deserializing JSON
4. Construct the classes
5. Create a list of race for query
6. Convert the advertised start time to long type - for easy handling
7. Sort the list by advertised start time
8. Get the current Unix time
9. Write the queries
